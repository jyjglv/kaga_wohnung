                &nbsp; I liked to travel around the world and especially enjoyed the travel with bicycle. 
                The reason why I wrote ‘liked’ and ‘enjoyed’ is, now I’m working in bad company that work all of weekdays even there’s a holiday between from Monday to Friday. 
                Just go to work all the year around excepting Saturday and Sunday. 
                Because of this situation, now I’m starting to forget the pleasure of travel. 
                Not to forget that, I started to look for other ordinary job, and am writing this posting to restore sense of travel. 
                I hope this Corona end soon and want to greet new season that I can travel freely.
            <br>
                &nbsp; Sorry. It was long about my trivial story. Today I want to introduce you about my travel style. 
                It can be a good tip to whom like to travel with local tour. 
                For me, ‘local’ means the village like where there’s no famous attraction, little information on internet and little tourist. 
                I tell you in advance, this posting won’t be a good tip for people who like to visit famous tourist attraction. 
                On the other hand, this posting can be advice to people who like to visit local village in other country and feel local atmosphere. 
                In my case, the proportion of [Local : Tour] is about 7:3. 
                Of course it’s not 100% of only local tour, I’m also want to see famous site sometimes. 
                But the information about famous places is plenty on web. So, I would omit that in my posting.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp; Three keywords for local travel are [Airbnb], [Smartphone Map] and [Bicycle]. Let’s look at each thing.
            </p>
            <div class="post_multiimage"><img src="./eng_2005_01.png"><img src="./eng_2005_02.png"><img src="./eng_2005_03.png"></div>
            <p>
                &nbsp; First, Airbnb. I don’t want to advertise Airbnb. But it’s true I was helped many things from Airbnb. 
                After appearing of this app, our option to choose hotel was widened dramatically. 
                Therefore, we can stay ordinary house in the country. 
                When I visited Finland, my room rented by Airbnb was second-floor house, and there’s traditional Finland sauna in the basement. 
                It’s hard to experience that if I stayed hotel in downtown. And during the travel, there’s no many chances to talk with natives. 
                In case if you stay the room with its owner, you can chat with them freely. 
                Then you can hear about many things like travel tips and cultural things. 
                And sometimes, there’s option that you can eat a meal in there. 
                Many of the meal are ordinary or traditional foods in the country. It would be also good memory for you.
            </p>
            <div class="post_multiimage"><img src="./eng_2005_04.jpg"><img src="./eng_2005_05.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                &nbsp; Second is using smartphone’s map. Nowadays, we can go anywhere alone without paper map or tourist information. 
                Because the app with GPS shows various means how we can go to the destination. 
                By walk, metro, subway and bus, it shows the means of route with transfer time. 
                Even it provides information which platform is closer to transfer quickly. 
                By using it, you can come and go from center of a city to suburban. 
                After get transport information, we don’t need to hesitate to go somewhere new, because we can back to our room safely anytime. 
                And try to search your place by using your keywords and go to uncertain restaurant and place. 
                Even though there wasn’t good, never mind. 
                It also will be your good memory in the distant future. Of course, delicious food is better than tasteless food. 
                But as for me, I miss a restaurant in Croatia. Its food was so-so, but there’s mood was fantastic. 
                And one thing more I’m glad is nobody knows the restaurant excepting native living in there. 
                The place is a memory that only I know.
            </p>
            <div class="post_multiimage"><img src="./eng_2005_06.jpg"><img src="./eng_2005_07.jpg"></div>
            <p>
                &nbsp; And the last is bicycle. Compared with Airbnb and Map app, riding bicycle is not easy. 
                Because there’s some possibility that no shops near from here or not good to ride bicycle by its road and weather condition. 
                Because I love bicycle, I went with my road bike or folding bike. 
                And sometimes I rented it in there by searching shop on internet. The merit of bicycle is mobility. 
                From town to town, city to city, we can move by public transportation. 
                But after setting down, usually we look around the place by walk. 
                Then if you ride a bicycle, you can see there efficiently and go deeper place. 
                It can be a chance to find new place and restaurant. 
                In my case, I rented a cross bike in Norway and ran without direction because I can come back whenever by using GPS in map. 
                During the trip, I climbed some mountain could see great view and found beautiful village and park. 
                Of course, there isn’t famous to foreigner.
            </p>

            <p>
                &nbsp; These three things are my tip for local travel. 
                These things were good for me, because I have traveled always alone. 
                If you have interest travelling alone or want to make a special memory with someone, I recommend the above tips. 
                I hope you have safe and enjoyable trip.
