My 1st website. <br>
Testsite for front-end studying. <br>
So it doesn't work several functions like shopping-cart and account management.

This website consists 3 pages. <br>
(1) Wicky : About my brother Wicky who is living in my hometown with my parents. <br>
(2) Kagashop : Audio devices online-shop. (Of course it doesn't work.) <br>
(3) Kagalog : It's like a opinion blog. It treats several subjects and I wrote my thinking about that. <br>
